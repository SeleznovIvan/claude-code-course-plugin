## Chapter 1.1: What is Claude Code?

### Deep Dive

#### What "Agentic" Really Means

An **agentic** coding assistant can take autonomous actions to complete tasks, not just provide suggestions. This includes:

- **Reading files** — scanning your entire codebase to understand context
- **Writing files** — making code changes directly (with permission)
- **Running commands** — executing shell commands like tests, builds, git operations
- **Making decisions** — choosing which tools to use and in what order
- **Iterating** — running tests, seeing failures, and fixing them autonomously

Traditional AI coding tools (like Copilot) are **reactive** — they suggest code as you type. Agentic tools are **proactive** — you describe the goal, and they work toward it.

#### Terminal-Native Advantages

Running in the terminal provides several benefits:

1. **Full filesystem access** — Claude can read any file, not just open tabs
2. **Shell integration** — can run any command your terminal can run
3. **No IDE lock-in** — works with any editor, any project
4. **Automation-ready** — can be scripted, piped, and integrated into workflows
5. **Resource efficiency** — no heavy IDE overhead

#### Memory Persistence via CLAUDE.md

Unlike session-based AI tools, Claude Code maintains project memory through:

- **CLAUDE.md** — project-specific context loaded every session
- **Hierarchical loading** — parent directories' CLAUDE.md files are inherited
- **Session continuation** — `-c` flag resumes previous conversations

## Chapter 1.2: Installation & Authentication

### Deep Dive

#### Node.js Requirements

Claude Code requires Node.js 18+ for modern JavaScript features and performance. Check your version:

```bash
node --version  # Should be v18.x or higher
```

If you need to upgrade, consider using a version manager like `nvm` or `fnm` for easier Node.js management.

#### Authentication Methods

Claude Code supports two authentication approaches:

1. **OAuth (Recommended)** — Browser-based login tied to your Claude subscription
   - Automatic token refresh
   - No API key management
   - Works with Pro, Max, Teams, and Enterprise plans

2. **API Key** — Direct Anthropic API authentication
   - Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Usage billed separately from subscription
   - Useful for CI/CD and automation

#### Common Installation Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Permission errors | Don't use `sudo npm install -g` — use a Node version manager instead |
| Command not found | Ensure npm bin is in your PATH |
| Authentication fails | Check if browser pop-up is blocked |
| Version mismatch | Run `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |

## Chapter 1.3: CLI Basics

### Deep Dive

#### Execution Modes Explained

| Mode | Command | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Interactive** | `claude` | Learning, exploration, multi-step tasks |
| **One-shot** | `claude "prompt"` | Quick questions, simple tasks |
| **Print** | `claude -p "prompt"` | Scripting, piping output, automation |
| **Continue** | `claude -c` | Resume previous conversation |

**Interactive mode** maintains a REPL-like experience where you have a conversation. Best for exploratory work.

**One-shot mode** runs a single prompt and exits. Claude still has full tool access.

**Print mode** (`-p`) outputs only Claude's response text — no interactive elements. Perfect for:
```bash
claude -p "Explain this error" | less
claude -p "Generate a function that..." > output.txt
```

#### Tool Visibility

When Claude uses tools, you'll see indicators:
- `Reading file...` — Examining your code
- `Writing file...` — Making changes (prompts for permission)
- `Running command...` — Executing shell commands (prompts for permission)
- `Searching...` — Using glob or grep to find files

#### Exit Methods

- Type `exit` — Graceful exit with session save
- `Ctrl+D` — EOF signal, equivalent to `exit`
- `Ctrl+C` — Cancel current operation (once)
- `Ctrl+C` twice — Hard exit

#### Security: .claudeignore

The `.claudeignore` file controls which files Claude Code is **not allowed to read**. This is critical for security because Claude Code has full filesystem access within your project.

**How it works:**
- Uses the same glob pattern syntax as `.gitignore`
- Placed in the project root
- Claude Code checks this file before reading any file
- Matched files are completely invisible to Claude — it cannot read, reference, or suggest changes to them

**Important distinction from .gitignore:**
- `.gitignore` prevents files from being tracked by git
- `.claudeignore` prevents files from being read by Claude Code
- A file in `.gitignore` is still readable by Claude unless also in `.claudeignore`
- Both files should include secrets and credentials

**Recommended patterns:**
```
# Secrets and credentials
.env
.env.*
*.pem
*.key
credentials.json
service-account*.json
**/secrets/**

# Package manager auth tokens
.npmrc
.pypirc
```

**When to add more patterns:**
- Private keys or certificates (`*.pfx`, `*.p12`)
- Local override configs with passwords (`docker-compose.override.yml`)
- Database dumps or seed files with real data
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or passwords

## Chapter 1.4: CLAUDE.md — Project Memory

### Deep Dive

#### Why Each Section Matters

| Section | Purpose | Without It |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Overview** | Establishes project context | Claude treats it as generic code |
| **Tech Stack** | Informs library/tool choices | May suggest wrong frameworks |
| **Architecture** | Guides file placement | Creates files in wrong locations |
| **Conventions** | Enforces coding style | Inconsistent code style |
| **Commands** | Enables running builds/tests | Can't verify its own changes |

#### File Referencing with `@path/to/file`

For large context, reference external files instead of inlining:

```markdown
## API Documentation
See @docs/api-spec.md for detailed endpoint documentation.

## Database Schema
Reference @prisma/schema.prisma for current data models.
```

This keeps CLAUDE.md concise while giving Claude access to detailed docs on demand.

#### Size Optimization Strategies

**Problem**: CLAUDE.md over 300 lines loses effectiveness.

**Solutions**:
1. **Move specs to separate files** — Use `@path` references
2. **Remove obvious context** — If Claude already knows it, don't repeat it
3. **Use hooks for enforcement** — Don't document rules Claude should verify
4. **Create skills for procedures** — Move step-by-step instructions to `.claude/skills/`
5. **Delete placeholders** — Remove TODO/FIXME before committing

#### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Instead of one massive CLAUDE.md, use hierarchy:

```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md                 # Project-wide context
├── src/
│   └── CLAUDE.md             # Source code conventions
├── tests/
│   └── CLAUDE.md             # Testing guidelines
└── docs/
    └── CLAUDE.md             # Documentation rules
```

Claude loads child CLAUDE.md files when working in those directories.

#### CLAUDE.md Best Practices Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing an existing CLAUDE.md or evaluating a newly created one:

**Structure (required sections):**
- [ ] Project overview — 2-3 sentences describing what the project does
- [ ] Tech stack — language, framework, testing, build tools
- [ ] Conventions — naming, file organization, code style
- [ ] Common commands — test, build, dev server, lint
- [ ] Key files — important entry points, configuration files

**Quality indicators:**
- [ ] Under 500 lines (warn at 300)
- [ ] Under 40,000 characters
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME placeholders remaining
- [ ] No unfilled `[bracket]` placeholders
- [ ] Uses `@path/to/file` references for detailed specs (if > 200 lines)

**Effectiveness:**
- [ ] Contains specific instructions, not generic advice
- [ ] References actual file paths in the project
- [ ] Includes "what NOT to do" rules where relevant
- [ ] Commands are correct and runnable
- [ ] Tech stack matches actual dependencies (check package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

**Advanced (optional but recommended):**
- [ ] Hierarchical CLAUDE.md files in subdirectories for large projects
- [ ] Skills referenced for reusable procedures (`.claude/skills/`)
- [ ] Architecture section with directory structure explanation

## Chapter 1.5: Testing Your Setup

### Deep Dive

#### Expected Claude Responses

When properly configured, Claude should:

1. **Know your project's purpose** without needing to scan files
2. **Reference your tech stack** when suggesting solutions
3. **Follow your conventions** when generating code
4. **Know command patterns** like how to run tests

#### Debugging Context Loading Issues

**Symptom**: Claude doesn't know project context

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Run `/context` to see what's loaded
2. Check CLAUDE.md exists in project root
3. Verify CLAUDE.md has required sections
4. Look for syntax errors in CLAUDE.md (especially YAML-like sections)

**Common Fixes**:
- Add more specific examples (not just descriptions)
- Include actual file paths
- Remove jargon and use concrete terms
- Add a "Key Files" section pointing to important code

#### Using `/context` Effectively

The `/context` command shows:
- Files currently in Claude's context
- Memory from CLAUDE.md
- Recent conversation context

Use it to verify Claude has the information it needs before asking complex questions.

## Chapter 1.6: Essential Slash Commands

### Deep Dive

#### `/clear` vs `/compact` — Detailed Difference

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `/clear` | Resets conversation completely | Starting fresh, context is wrong |
| `/compact` | Summarizes and compresses context | Running low on context, want to continue |

**`/compact`** is intelligent compression — it keeps essential information while reducing token usage. Use when you get warnings about context limits.

**`/clear`** is a hard reset — nothing from the current conversation persists. Use when Claude is confused or you want a fresh start.

#### Session Management Deep Dive

**Finding Your Session ID:**
```bash
# In a Claude session
/config  # Shows session info

# Or check the directory
ls ~/.claude/projects/
```

**Session ID Uses:**
- Resume specific sessions: `claude -r <session-id>`
- Share logs for debugging
- Export for analysis

#### Context Management Deep Dive

Understanding context is crucial for effective Claude Code usage. The context window is Claude's "working memory" — everything it can reference at once.

**What counts toward context:**
- System prompt (base instructions)
- CLAUDE.md file content
- All conversation messages (your prompts + Claude's responses)
- Tool results (file reads, command output, search results)
- Skill/command content when invoked

**Performance by context usage:**

| Usage Range | Performance Impact | What To Do |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0–50% | Full quality, fast responses | Keep working normally |
| 50–75% | Good quality, slightly slower | Monitor, start planning compaction |
| 75–90% | Noticeable quality drop | Run `/compact` to free space |
| 90–100% | Degraded, may miss details | Run `/compact` or `/clear` immediately |

**Autocompact behavior:**
- Triggers automatically when context approaches the limit
- Summarizes earlier conversation while preserving recent messages
- CLAUDE.md and system instructions are always preserved
- You may notice a brief pause when it runs
- Manual `/compact` gives you control over when compression happens

**Practical context workflows:**

1. **Long task**: Work → check `/context` → `/compact` when over 75% → continue
2. **Fresh start with plan**: Write plan to file → `/clear` → reference `@plan.md` → work in clean context
3. **Multiple attempts**: If approach isn't working → `/clear` → try different angle with full context available

#### /statusline Best Practices

The status line provides persistent, at-a-glance information while you work. Configuring it well reduces the need to run `/context` or `/config` repeatedly.

**Recommended configuration:**
- **Context usage %** — the most important metric; tells you when to compact
- **Model name** — confirms you're on the right model (Sonnet vs Opus)
- **Git branch** — prevents accidental commits to wrong branches
- **Project name** — helps when switching between projects

**When it's especially useful:**
- Long coding sessions where context fills up
- Working across multiple projects in different terminals
- Pair programming or screen sharing (others can see your session state)

#### CLI Flags Reference

| Flag | Long Form | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `-p` | `--print` | Output only, no interactive |
| `-c` | `--continue` | Resume last session |
| `-r` | `--resume` | Resume specific session by ID |
| `--max-turns N` | — | Limit agentic iterations |
| `--model NAME` | — | Use specific model |
| `--no-permissions` | — | Disable permission prompts (careful!) |
| `--add-dir PATH` | — | Add additional working directories |

## Chapter 1.7: Plan Mode

### Deep Dive

#### Plan Output Format

When in plan mode, Claude produces structured plans:

```markdown
## Plan: [Task Name]

### Understanding
[Claude's interpretation of the task]

### Approach
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

### Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` — [what changes]
- `path/to/test.ts` — [new test file]

### Risks & Considerations
- [Potential issues]
- [Edge cases]
```

#### How to Evaluate Plan Quality

Good plans should:
- ✅ Reference actual files in your codebase
- ✅ Follow your project's conventions
- ✅ Include testing/verification steps
- ✅ Identify potential risks

Red flags:
- ❌ Generic patterns not matching your stack
- ❌ Missing test considerations
- ❌ Unclear about file locations
- ❌ Ignoring existing code patterns

#### Examples: Good vs Poor Plans

**Good Plan:**
> "I'll add the login feature to `src/auth/login.tsx`, following your existing pattern in `register.tsx`. I'll create a test in `__tests__/login.test.tsx` using your Jest + RTL setup."

**Poor Plan:**
> "I'll create a new Login component with standard React patterns and add appropriate tests."

The good plan shows Claude understands your specific codebase.

#### Plan Mode as a Thinking Tool

Plan mode is most powerful when used as a **deliberation tool** rather than an execution step:

**The iterate-and-discard pattern:**
1. Enter plan mode → request a plan
2. Iterate 2-3 times with feedback ("What about X?", "Can you split step 3?")
3. Press Escape to exit **without executing**
4. Save the plan to a file if it's good: copy the plan to `plan.md`
5. `/clear` to get fresh context
6. Reference `@plan.md` and execute with full context available

**Why this works:**
- Planning consumes context — a long planning session can eat 30-50% of your context window
- By saving the plan to a file and clearing, you get the best of both worlds: a well-thought-out plan AND full context for execution
- The iterate step catches edge cases and improves plan quality before any code is written

**Warning about context during planning:**
- Each iteration adds to context usage
- Long planning sessions (5+ rounds) can consume significant context
- If you see context above 60% after planning, consider the save → clear → reload pattern

#### Plan Modification Techniques

If the plan isn't right:
1. **Ask for alternatives**: "What other approaches could work?"
2. **Add constraints**: "I need this to work with X"
3. **Request detail**: "Explain step 3 more"
4. **Reject and redirect**: "Instead of X, let's do Y"

## Chapter 1.8: Custom Commands

### Deep Dive

#### All Frontmatter Options

```yaml
---
name: command-name           # Required: becomes /command-name
description: What it does    # Required: shown in /help
allowed-tools:               # Optional: auto-approve these tools
  - Bash
  - Edit
  - Read
---
```

#### Commands with Parameters

Commands receive arguments after the command name:

```markdown
---
name: new-component
description: Create a new React component
---

Create a new React component with the name provided as the argument.
The component should:
1. Be placed in `src/components/{name}/`
2. Include `{name}.tsx`, `{name}.test.tsx`, and `index.ts`
3. Follow our existing component patterns
```

Usage: `/new-component UserProfile`

The argument "UserProfile" is passed to Claude as context.

#### Skills vs Commands Decision Tree

```
Should this be a Skill or Command?

Is it invoked with a slash command?
├── Yes → Could be either
│   └── Does it need parameters?
│       ├── Yes → Command
│       └── No → Does it encode reusable knowledge?
│           ├── Yes → Skill
│           └── No → Command
└── No → Should Claude detect when to use it?
    ├── Yes → Skill
    └── No → Probably neither
```

**Commands**: Explicit invocation, often with parameters, specific tasks
**Skills**: Reusable knowledge, can be auto-detected, encode patterns

#### Using Claude Code to Build Claude Code

A core practice: **always use Claude Code to create Claude Code configurations**. This applies to:

- **Commands** — Prompt Claude to create `.claude/commands/*.md` files
- **Skills** — Prompt Claude to create `.claude/skills/*.md` files
- **Hooks** — Prompt Claude to configure `.claude/hooks/` entries
- **CLAUDE.md** — Use `/init` or prompt Claude to enhance your CLAUDE.md
- **MCP configs** — Prompt Claude to set up `.mcp.json`

**Why this works better than manual creation:**
1. **Claude knows the format** — correct frontmatter, proper sections, valid syntax
2. **Adapts to your project** — Claude reads your codebase and tailors instructions accordingly
3. **Practices prompting** — the meta-skill of describing what you want Claude to build
4. **Catches mistakes** — Claude validates its own output against conventions

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "Create a /review command that reviews the current git diff,
     checks for our team's coding standards, and outputs a summary"

Claude: [reads your CLAUDE.md, understands your conventions,
        creates .claude/commands/review.md with proper frontmatter
        and project-specific instructions]

You: [review the result, test it, suggest tweaks]
```

#### Testing Custom Commands

1. Create the command file
2. Start a new Claude session (or restart current)
3. Type `/help` — your command should appear
4. Invoke with `/your-command-name`
5. Verify Claude follows the instructions

## Chapter 1.9: Commit Your Work

### Deep Dive

#### What to Commit — `.claude/` Decisions

**Always commit:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project context, shared with team
- `.claude/commands/` — Team-shared custom commands
- `.claude/skills/` — Team-shared skills

**Consider carefully:**
- `.claude/settings.json` — May contain personal preferences
- `.claude/memory/` — Usually personal, not shared

**Never commit:**
- API keys or secrets referenced in any file
- Personal configuration that conflicts with team settings

#### `.gitignore` Recommendations

```gitignore
# Claude Code personal files (optional)
.claude/settings.local.json
.claude/memory/

# Don't ignore these (they're meant to be shared)
# .claude/commands/
# .claude/skills/
# CLAUDE.md
```

#### Commit Message Conventions

Follow your project's conventions, but good Claude Code commits:

```
Add Claude Code configuration

- Add CLAUDE.md with project context and conventions
- Add custom /new-component command for React workflow
- Configure tech stack and common commands

Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Include `Co-authored-by` if Claude helped write the code.
